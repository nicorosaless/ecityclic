# eCityclic Hackathon Project

This project was developed during a 24-hour hackathon organized by eCityclic, with the goal of creating an innovative and functional solution in a limited time. The solution suggests procedures based on a history of previously performed procedures.

## Overview

The project leverages machine learning to recommend administrative procedures (tramits) by analyzing user history. It consists of a data processing pipeline and an interactive web application.

### Technologies Used

- **Data Processing**: Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing and analyzing data.
- **User Interface**: Streamlit for presenting results interactively.

## Features

- **Procedure Recommendation**: Suggests relevant procedures based on user history.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit for easy exploration of recommendations.
- **Modular Code**: Functions are well-separated by responsibility for maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Code includes comments and explanations for better understanding.

## Project Structure

- `model/`: Contains the machine learning model and notebook.
  - `model.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training.
  - `modelo_transformer_tramites.h5`: Trained model file.
- `premi_eps/`: Presentation slides and designs.
- `streamlit/`: Streamlit application.
  - `frontend.py`: Frontend interface.
  - `backend.py`: Backend logic.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicorosaless/ecityclic.git
   cd ecityclic
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If available, or install streamlit, tensorflow, etc.
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit/frontend.py
   ```

## Usage

- Open the Streamlit app in your browser.
- Input your procedure history to get recommendations.
- Explore the interactive features for insights.

## Improvements and Known Issues

- **Language Consistency**: Some parts of the model implementation are in Spanish, while the rest of the code is in English. Future updates should standardize to English.
